# Node.js Logging Examples

* Using `console.log`
* Using [log4js](https://log4js-node.github.io/log4js-node)
* Using [pino](https://github.com/pinojs/pino)
* Using [winston](https://github.com/winstonjs/winston#filtering-info-objects)


Run:

```
node index.js
```

Also, you can set environment variables for different log variations:

```
LOG_LEVEL (varies by framework, info and error are common)
NODE_ENV (production or development)
LOG_FILENAME (to log out a file)
```

You can change around `index.js` to experiment with the different frameworks.
